## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Google Sheets Setup

#### Step 1: Create Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (or select an existing one)
3. Enable the **Google Sheets API**:
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Google Sheets API"
   - Click "Enable"

#### Step 2: Create Service Account

1. Go to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts"
2. Click "Create Service Account"
3. Give it a name (e.g., "attendee-checkin-service")
4. Click "Create and Continue"
5. Grant it the **Editor** role (or "Editor" role for the specific sheet)
6. Click "Done"
7. Click on the created service account
8. Go to the "Keys" tab
9. Click "Add Key" > "Create new key"
10. Select "JSON" format
11. Download the JSON key file and save it as `credentials.json` in the project root

#### Step 3: Prepare Google Sheet

1. Create a Google Sheet with your attendee data
2. **First row must contain headers** (e.g., Name, Company, Email, Phone, etc.)
3. **Optional columns** (automatically detected):
   - Columns with "color" or "colour" in the name → displayed as colored pills
   - Columns with "spoc" or "host" in the name → displayed in top section
   - Columns with "print" or "printed" in the name → displayed as print status badge
4. **Get your Sheet ID**:
   - Open your Google Sheet
   - Look at the URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/YOUR_SHEET_ID/edit`
   - Copy the `YOUR_SHEET_ID` part (the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`)
5. **Share the sheet**:
   - Click "Share" button in Google Sheets
   - Add the service account email (found in `credentials.json` as `client_email`)
   - Give it **Editor** access (required for writing check-in status)
   - Click "Send"

#### Step 4: Configure Sheet ID and Range

The app supports **three ways** to configure the Google Sheet:

##### Option A: Server-Side Configuration (Recommended for Single Team/Sheet)

Set environment variables in `.env` file:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:
```env
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_actual_sheet_id_here
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./credentials.json
GOOGLE_SHEET_RANGE=Sheet1!A:Z
DISABLE_CHECKIN_TIME_LOGGING=false
PORT=3000
```

**Notes:**
- `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`: Your Google Sheet ID (required)
- `GOOGLE_SHEET_RANGE`: Sheet range to read (default: `Sheet1!A:Z`)
  - Format: `SheetName!A:Z` (e.g., `Sheet1!A:Z`, `Attendees!A:AA`)
  - Use `A:Z` to read columns A through Z
  - Use `A:AA` to read columns A through AA (27 columns)
  - The app will automatically create "Check-In Status" column (and "Check-In Time" column if time logging is enabled) if they don't exist
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: Path to your service account JSON file
- `DISABLE_CHECKIN_TIME_LOGGING`: Set to `true` or `1` to disable check-in time logging (default: `false`)
  - When disabled, only the check-in status (true/false) will be written to the sheet
  - The "Check-In Time" column will not be created or updated
  - Useful if you only need to track attendance status without timestamps
- `GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_WEBHOOK_URL` (optional): URL of a deployed Google Apps Script Web App to notify after each successful check-in
  - Server sends `POST { "sheetName": "Sheet1", "rowIndex": 2 }` after marking an attendee as checked-in
  - `rowIndex` is the 1-based row number in the sheet (row 1 is header, row 2 is first data row)
  - Webhook is only called when checking in (not when checking out)
  - Leave empty to disable webhook notifications
  - **Note**: Webhook URL can also be configured via frontend modal or URL parameter (takes priority over environment variable)

##### Option B: Frontend Configuration (Recommended for Multiple Teams/Sheets)

1. **Don't set** `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` in `.env` (or leave it empty)
2. When you open the app, a configuration modal will appear
3. Enter your Sheet ID, Range, and optional Webhook URL
4. The configuration is saved in your browser's localStorage
5. You can change it anytime using the gear icon (⚙️) in the header

**Configuration Fields:**
- **Sheet ID** (required): Your Google Sheet ID
- **Sheet Range** (optional): Range to read (default: `Sheet1!A:Z`)
- **Webhook URL** (optional): Google Apps Script Web App URL for check-in notifications

**Benefits:**
- Different users can use different sheets
- No need to redeploy when switching sheets
- Configuration persists in browser
- Webhook URL can be configured per user/session

##### Option C: URL Parameters

You can also provide the sheet ID, range, and webhook URL via URL:

```
http://localhost:3000?sheetId=YOUR_SHEET_ID&range=Sheet1!A:Z&webhookUrl=YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL
```

**URL Parameters:**
- `sheetId` (required): Your Google Sheet ID
- `range` (optional): Sheet range (default: `Sheet1!A:Z`)
- `webhookUrl` (optional): Google Apps Script Web App URL

**Priority Order:**
1. URL parameters (highest priority)
2. Browser localStorage (if configured via frontend)
3. Environment variables (if set in `.env`)

**⚠️ Security Note**: 
- Never commit `.env` or `credentials.json` to version control
- Each user/team should create their own Google Cloud project and service account
- The `.gitignore` file is already configured to exclude these files
- For production, use environment variables provided by your hosting platform

### 3. Run the App

**Development:**
```bash
npm run dev-build  # Build frontend
npm run dev        # Start server
```

**Production:**
```bash
npm run build      # Build frontend
npm start          # Start server
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`

**Configuration Status:**
- If no sheet ID is configured (via environment variables, frontend modal, or URL), the app will show a **configuration modal** asking you to enter a Sheet ID
- **Demo mode** (sample data) is only available if both Google Sheets credentials AND sheet ID are completely missing - this is mainly for development/testing
- In normal usage, you should configure at least the credentials (for server-side) or use the frontend configuration modal
- Check `/api/health` endpoint to verify your configuration status
- The health endpoint shows detailed diagnostics about your Google Sheets setup

## Usage

### Basic Operations

1. **Search**: Type a few letters to find attendees by name or company
   - Results appear as you type (debounced search with 300ms delay)
   - Shows all attendees by default when search is empty
   - Search results are limited to top 20 matches
   
2. **Check-in**: Click the checkbox to mark attendance
   - Card color updates instantly (optimistic UI)
   - Count updates immediately, then syncs with server
   - Check-in status is written to Google Sheet as boolean `true`/`false`
   
3. **Sync**: Use the "Sync Sheet" button to sync existing check-ins from Google Sheet
   - Useful when check-ins were made directly in Google Sheets
   - Refreshes the displayed attendee list

4. **Configure Sheet**: Click the gear icon (⚙️) in the header to change sheet configuration
   - Enter new Sheet ID, Range, and optional Webhook URL
   - Configuration is saved in browser localStorage
   - Webhook URL is used to notify Google Apps Script after each successful check-in

### Attendee Display

Each attendee card is divided into two sections:

#### Main Section (Always Visible)

The main section displays the most important information in a structured layout:

**First Row (Header Row):**
- **Name** (left, large font): Automatically detected from columns containing "name" (e.g., "Name", "Full Name", "Attendee Name")
- **Company** (center, large font): Automatically detected from columns containing "company", "organization", or "employer"
- **Print Status Badge** (next to company): 
  - Detects columns with "print" or "printed" in the name (case-insensitive)
  - Shows only the **first** print field found
  - Displayed as a badge with color coding:
    - **Printed** (white background, black text): If value is `true`, "yes", "true", or "printed"
    - **Not Printed** (light red background, dark red text): If value is `false`, "no", "not printed", or any other negative value
  - Supports boolean values and text strings
- **SPOC/Host** (right-aligned): 
  - Detects columns with "spoc" or "host" in the name (case-insensitive)
  - Shows only the **first** SPOC field found
  - Always displays with label "SPOC:" (hardcoded, regardless of actual column name)
  - Example: Column named "Host Name" or "SPOC Contact" will show as "SPOC: [value]"

**Second Row (Color Row):**
- **Color/Colour Fields**: 
  - Detects **all** columns with "color" or "colour" in the name (case-insensitive)
  - **All** color columns are displayed (not just the first one)
  - Each color field is shown as a colored pill with:
    - Background color matching the color value (if valid)
    - Text color automatically adjusted for readability (black on light colors, white on dark colors)
    - Black border around each pill
    - Label uses the actual column name (e.g., "Team Color:", "Badge Colour:")
  - Supports common color names (e.g., "Red", "Blue", "Green", "Yellow")
  - Supports compound colors (e.g., "Crimson Red", "Charcoal Grey")
  - Falls back to plain text if color cannot be parsed

**Layout Structure:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Checkbox] Name | Company [Print Badge] │
│                 SPOC: [value]            │
│ Color1: [pill] Color2: [pill] ...      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Details Section (Toggle with "Show Details" Checkbox)

- **All other fields** from your Google Sheet that are not:
  - Name, Company (shown in header)
  - Print/Printed fields (shown as badge)
  - SPOC/Host fields (shown in header)
  - Color/Colour fields (shown as pills)
  - Internal fields (id, checkedIn, checkInTime)
- Examples: Email, Phone, Title, Department, Dietary Restrictions, Notes, etc.
- Fields are displayed as "Label: Value" pairs
- Empty fields are automatically hidden
- Toggle preference is saved in browser localStorage (defaults to enabled/checked)

#### Column Detection Rules

The app uses **flexible, case-insensitive matching**:
- **Name**: Looks for columns containing "name" (e.g., "Name", "Full Name", "Attendee Name")
- **Company**: Looks for "company", "organization", or "employer"
- **Print**: Looks for "print" or "printed" anywhere in column name
- **SPOC/Host**: Looks for "spoc" or "host" anywhere in column name
- **Color**: Looks for "color" or "colour" anywhere in column name

**Important Notes:**
- Multiple columns matching the same pattern are handled differently:
  - **Color fields**: All are displayed
  - **Print fields**: Only the first one is shown in header
  - **SPOC fields**: Only the first one is shown
- Column names are case-insensitive (e.g., "Team Color", "TEAM COLOR", "team color" all work)
- Partial matches work (e.g., "Print Status", "Printed", "Not Printed" all match)

### Automatic Column Detection

The app automatically:
- **Detects** columns by flexible name matching (case-insensitive, partial matches)
- **Creates** "Check-In Status" column if it doesn't exist
- **Creates** "Check-In Time" column if it doesn't exist and time logging is enabled (see `DISABLE_CHECKIN_TIME_LOGGING` configuration)
- **Places** new columns in empty columns to avoid overwriting existing data
- **Reads** check-in status directly from Google Sheet (source of truth)

### Real-time Updates

- **Counts**: Header displays "Total Leads" and "Checked In" counts
  - Total Leads: Total number of rows/attendees in the sheet
  - Checked In: Number of attendees who have checked in
  - Both counts update every 23 seconds to reflect changes from other users
- **Attendee List**: Auto-refreshes every 45 seconds to show external changes
- **Check-in**: Updates instantly with optimistic UI, then syncs with server

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to fetch attendees" or "Failed to connect to Google Sheet"**:
- ✅ Check that `credentials.json` exists and is valid
- ✅ Verify `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` path in `.env` is correct
- ✅ Ensure Google Sheets API is enabled in your Google Cloud project
- ✅ Verify the sheet ID is correct (check the URL)
- ✅ Ensure the sheet is shared with the service account email (from `credentials.json`)
- ✅ Check that service account has **Editor** access (not Viewer)
- ✅ Visit `/api/health` endpoint for detailed diagnostics

**Check-ins not updating sheet**:
- ✅ Verify service account has **Editor** access (required for writing)
- ✅ Check that Google Sheets API is enabled
- ✅ Ensure "Check-In Status" column exists (app creates it automatically)
- ✅ Check browser console for error messages

**Card status not updating when sheet changes**:
- ✅ Card status auto-refreshes every 45 seconds
- ✅ Count updates every 23 seconds
- ✅ Use "Sync Sheet" button for immediate refresh
- ✅ Check that check-in status in sheet is boolean `true`/`false` or recognized text values

**"Sheet ID is required" error**:
- ✅ Set `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` in `.env`, OR
- ✅ Configure via frontend modal (gear icon), OR
- ✅ Provide via URL parameter: `?sheetId=YOUR_ID`

**Configuration modal appears on page load**:
- ✅ This is normal if no sheet ID is configured
- ✅ Enter your Sheet ID and Range in the modal
- ✅ Configuration is saved in browser localStorage
- ✅ You can change it later using the gear icon (⚙️) in the header

**Demo data showing instead of real data**:
- ✅ Demo mode only appears if both credentials AND sheet ID are completely missing (development/testing scenario)
- ✅ In normal usage, configure credentials and provide sheet ID via environment variables, frontend modal, or URL parameters
- ✅ Check `/api/health` to see configuration status
- ✅ Verify sheet ID and credentials are correct
- ✅ Ensure sheet is shared with service account

**Column overwrite issue**:
- ✅ App now checks for empty columns before creating new ones
- ✅ Automatically finds first empty column to avoid overwriting data
- ✅ Supports columns beyond Z (AA, AB, etc.)

## Security

- Never commit `credentials.json` or `.env` files
- Use environment variables for production deployment
- Keep service account permissions minimal
